## Introduction

When working with web applications, it can be essential to extract specific pieces of the source code, such as variable names and parameters used in href links, to gain insights into the application's design and implementation. FAllParams streamlines this process by providing an easy-to-use tool to fetch and analyze the desired elements from web pages.

## Features

- Fetches variable names and parameter details from web application source code.
- Identifies and extracts parameters used in href links.
- Provides command-line interface for simple and efficient usage.
- Allows developers and security researchers to better understand application structures.
- Actively maintained and open to contributions.
